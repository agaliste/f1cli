# F1CLI

F1CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Rust. It provides various commands to interact with Formula 1 static post session data.

Generally, F1 generates the data 30 minutes after the session ends. This tool provides a way to access the data from the terminal.

## Introduction

This project is not serious and is just a fun way I found to learn Rust. So the pace of development will be slow and the features will be limited, or maybe not. Who knows?

## How does it work?

The tool uses the `livetiming.formula1.com/static/` API to fetch the data. The data is fetched in JSON format and then parsed to display the information in a human-readable format.

This API "as far as I know" is public but not documented. So, the tool might break if the API changes. I'll try to keep it updated as much as possible.

## Functionality

These are the features that are planned to be implemented or are already implemented. If I've missed something, I'll add it later.

The information available ranges from 2018 to the present.
